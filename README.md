**Patient Triage Gen AI** is an intelligent application designed to prioritize patients based on the severity of their medical conditions. It uses a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture powered by **Groq** and **ChromaDB** to provide accurate and context-aware triage recommendations.

## üöÄ **Key Features**
- **Patient Triage Levels**: Assigns one of 5 triage levels based on severity:
  - Level 1: Resuscitation (Immediate life-threatening condition)
  - Level 2: Emergency (Potentially life-threatening condition)
  - Level 3: Urgent (Serious but not life-threatening condition)
  - Level 4: Semi-Urgent (Less serious condition)
  - Level 5: Non-Urgent (Minor or stable condition)
- **Knowledge Base**: Uses a comprehensive database of medical guidelines and protocols for triage.
- **RAG Architecture**: Combines retrieval of relevant guidelines with generative AI for detailed explanations.
- **Console-Based Interface**: Provides a user-friendly console interface for input and output.
- **Real-Time Processing**: Generates triage reports in real-time using Groq's high-performance LLM.
